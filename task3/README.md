# Task 3

## Creating a pull request

So far you fixed a typo in task0/, commit-ed the changes and pushed it to your fork.

Now, this change is only for your fork - we need to now "request" these changes to the "upstream".

I hope you remember "origin" -> Origin is the place where you cloned your repository from. 
"Upstream" is usually the place from you forked your fork from. Which is my repository at: `github.com/learn-git` and this is the "upstream"

We need to fix the typo on upstream - because that's where it matters, that's where everyone goes and forks the repository. No one is going to fork your repository. Sorry.
So if you fix something in upstream, everyone else who uses the repository will be able to apply your changes.

Now we need to send a "pull request" (PR) to the upstream. A "pull request" is a request to bring the changes you made to the repository so that everyone can use it.

This is fairly simple to do. You can use the GitHub website to do this, just head over to your fork and find this button:

Fill in a reasonable description and click more buttons - viola! Your first PR!
